## Description
I am tasked with creating a portfolio page that looks as professional as possible.

I added some HTML elements including an image, some content in the body, a footer, and a header with a heading, some nav elements, and used CSS to style the nav elements. I also made the background color of the header and footer red via CSS. Finally I made the nav elements all link to a destination.

I changed the font using CSS to Cambria. I also added a caption under the image.

I added a heading titled projects above my first project and had it underlined. However, there is trouble with the image caption.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
