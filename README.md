## Description
I am tasked with creating a portfolio page that looks as professional as possible.

I added some HTML elements including an image, some content in the body, a footer, and a header with a heading, some nav elements, and used CSS to style the nav elements. I also made the background color of the header and footer red via CSS. Finally I made the nav elements all link to a destination.

I changed the font using CSS to Cambria. I also added a caption under the image.

I added a heading titled projects above my first project and had it underlined. However, there is trouble with the image caption.

I fixed the positioning of the header and the footer on the page as well as the nav elements.

I centered the content on the page along with adding an image of the project. I also centered the text on the image and increased the font weight.

I added a black background and made the color of the content white. I also the nav elements turn green when they are hovered over.

Added links to the github repo and the website for the first and only project listed right now.

Made the banner image a flex container and made it so taht the footer stays at the bottom of the screen when the window is resized.

## Instalation
To install my project, I created a repository for it on Github. After that I cloned the repository onto my desktop. I then copied the folders from my class repository and pasted them into my folder. From there, I opened the assignments into a serperate folder.
